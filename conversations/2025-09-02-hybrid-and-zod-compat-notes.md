# DHI Conversation Notes — Zod Parity + Hybrid Validator (2025-09-02)

## Summary

Scoped work to improve the Zod-compatible facade toward M1 parity, add a practical typed vs WASM benchmarking harness, and introduce a hybrid validator that automatically chooses the fastest engine (typed or WASM) for batch validation. Updated tests and docs, and adjusted default test scripts to avoid requiring Rust by default.

## Key Changes

1) Zod-compat parity improvements (src/zod-compat.ts)
- Added async methods: `parseAsync`, `safeParseAsync`.
- Added `is(value)` on all schemas.
- Optionality/nullability: `.optional()` and `.nullable()` wrappers for all schemas.
- Object semantics: default `strip` unknown keys, with `.passthrough()`, `.strip()`, `.strict()`.
- Unions: `z.union([...])`; Discriminated unions: `z.discriminatedUnion(key, cases)`.
- Richer `ZodError` with shape `{ code, message, path, params? }` and methods `.flatten()` and `.toString()`; proper path propagation for arrays/objects.
- String validators: `min`, `max`, `length`, `nonempty`, `regex`, `email`, `url`; transforms `trim`, `toLowerCase`, `toUpperCase`, `transform`.
- Number validators: `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `int`, `positive`, `negative`.
- Array validators: `min`, `max`, `length`, `nonempty`.
- Record validation with path propagation.

2) Typed fast-path invalid performance (src/typed.ts)
- Added early-exit short-circuiting in object batch validators (1–4 fields and N-field path) to stop evaluating remaining fields after the first failure. This reduces time on invalid-heavy batches.

3) Hybrid validator (src/hybrid.ts)
- Introduced `createHybridValidator(typedSchema, wasmSchema, { threshold=0.3, sample=200 })`.
- Behavior:
  - `validate(value)` and `safeParse(value)` delegate to typed schema (no WASM overhead).
  - `validateBatch(values)` samples a small prefix via typed to estimate invalid rate. If rate > threshold, routes the whole batch to WASM’s `validate_batch`; otherwise, uses typed `validateBatch`.
- Exported from `src/index.ts` for app use.

4) Benchmarks & examples
- Benchmarks: added `benchmarks/typed_vs_wasm.ts/.mjs/.cjs` variants and npm scripts.
- Example: `examples/hybrid.mjs` comparing typed, WASM, and hybrid timings and counts.

5) Tests & scripts
- Tests: added `tests/zod-compat.test.ts` (for facade) and `tests/hybrid.test.ts` (hybrid parity on booleans + routing sanity).
- Scripts: changed default `npm test` to run only Jest; kept `test:wasm` as optional.
- Docs: updated AGENTS.md test script notes.

  - `src/hybrid.ts`: `createHybridValidator` implementation.

## How to Run

- Unit tests (Jest only by default):
  - `npm test` or `npm run test:jest`
  - Optional WASM tests (require Rust/wasm-pack): `npm run test:wasm`

- Benchmarks (no Bun):
  - ESM dist-based: `npm run build && npm run benchmark:node:dist`
  - ts-node: `npm run benchmark:node` (may depend on local ESM loader behavior)

- Hybrid example:
  - `npm run example:hybrid:dist` (runs build then Node ESM example)

## Observed Timings (example run)

On a representative run shared during the session:
- `[Typed] valid`: ~3 ms
- `[Typed] invalid`: ~22–38 ms (improved after early-exit)
- `[WASM] valid`: ~13–22 ms
- `[WASM] invalid`: ~3–6 ms
- `[Hybrid] valid`: ~1.6 ms
- `[Hybrid] invalid`: ~3.8 ms

Interpretation:
- For valid-heavy batches, typed fast paths are best.
- For invalid-heavy batches, WASM is faster.
- Hybrid selects the faster path without user intervention while keeping typed’s simple single-object UX.

## Design Notes

- Hybrid is opt-in. Making it the global default would pull a WASM dependency into all consumers (including web bundles), which conflicts with DHI’s typed-first design goals and small payload targets.
- The Zod-compat facade remains intentionally scoped. We added M1-targeted features but did not attempt full Zod parity (e.g., complete effects/refinements, error maps, all primitives/collections) unless requested.

## Follow-ups (Optional)

- Add Node-only helper to derive a WASM schema from a typed shape automatically (reduce duplication in hybrid setup).
- Extend Zod-compat with effects (`refine`, `superRefine`, `preprocess`) and error map support if needed.
- Silence wasm-pack `initSync` deprecation warning fully in `src/wasm.ts` if noisy.
- Add a simple “engine chosen” debug flag in hybrid for observability.

Notes:
- For small flat objects (4-field), typed ≈ hybrid and both beat WASM; Zod trails.
- Nested objects: WASM slightly wins; hybrid close behind; both beat Zod.
- Array-heavy: typed/hybrid dominate; WASM trails due to overhead; Zod slower.
- Mixed valid/invalid: hybrid routes to WASM and beats typed by selecting the faster engine for invalid paths; both dominate Zod.

## FAQ: How bundler “references” affect WASM inclusion

- Bundlers include modules that are reachable from your imports. DHI exports are side‑effect‑free and tree‑shakeable, so unused exports drop out.
- Typed‑only browser usage stays WASM‑free:
  - `import { object, string, number } from 'dhi'`
  - `import { z } from 'dhi'`
  - `import type { ObjectSchema } from 'dhi'`
- Avoid patterns that keep everything reachable or directly import the legacy path:
  - `import * as DHI from 'dhi'` (prevents tree‑shaking)
  - `import { dhi } from 'dhi'` (pulls WASM)
  - `createHybridValidator` is fine, but becomes WASM‑referential only once you construct schemas via `dhi.*`.
- Keep hybrid/legacy usage in server‑only files; split files by environment so bundlers can statically exclude server‑only code from client bundles.
